##### CONFIG FILE #####
# Author: Clara Bayley
# File: config.txt
# File containing configuration 
# for initial conditions & parameters 
# of CVODE ODE solver and SDM

#  Note: inital superdroplets data (eps, r0 and m_sol (and optionally coord3))
#  read from file "initSDs_filename" is made with PYSD module using python
#  script "create_initsuperdropsbinary_script". Likewise data to make 
#  gridboxmap from gridbox boundaries is read from file "grid_filename"
#  created using python "create_gbxboundariesbinary_script" script.

### input file parameters ###
initSDs_filename = ./share/dimlessSDsinit.dat       # binary filename for initialisation of superdrops
grid_filename = ./share/dimlessGBxboundaries.dat    # binary filename for gridbox boundaries

### output data parameters ###

maxcsize = 8192                             # maximum size of chunks of output data put into a zarr store array

### SDM parameters ###

COND_TSTEP = 0.1                        # time between SD condensation events [s]

OUT_TSTEP = 30                          # time between outputting data (and coupling) [s]
TEND = 2400                             # time span of integration [s]

### superdroplet params ###
nSDsvec = 50                         # initial no. elements in superdroplets' vector ( = initial total no. of superdroplets)
SDnspace = 1                           # no. of spatial coordinates of superdroplets ( = dimension of model)

### initial thermodynamic conditions ###
P_INIT = 100000.0                       # initial pressure [Pa]
TEMP_INIT = 273.15                      # initial parcel temperature [T]
