 * configuration input parameters for CLEO
 * Note: inital superdroplets data (eps, r0 and m_sol etc.)
 * read from file "initsupers_filename" is made with PYSD module
 * using python script "create_initsuperdropsbinary_script".
 * Likewise data to make gridboxmap from gridbox boundaries is
 * read from file "grid_filename" created using python
 * "create_gbxboundariesbinary_script" script.
