##### CONFIG FILE #####
# Author: Clara Bayley
# File: condconfig.txt
# File containing configuration for
# running CLEO in 0D setup coupled 
# to CVODE ODE solver with condensation
# with wetradiiinit 

#  Note: inital superdroplets data (eps, r0 and m_sol) read from 
#  file "initSDs_filename" is made with PYSD module using python
#  script "create_initsuperdropsbinary_script". Likewise data to make 
#  gridboxmap from gridbox boundaries is read from file "grid_filename"
#  created using python "create_gbxboundariesbinary_script" script.

### Initialisation Files parameters ###
initSDs_filename = ./share/dimlessSDsinit.dat            # binary filename for initialisation of superdrops
grid_filename = ./share/dimlessGBxboundaries.dat         # binary filename for gridbox boundaries

### Output Data parameters ###

maxchunk = 1250000                          # maximum no. of elements in chunks of zarr store array
