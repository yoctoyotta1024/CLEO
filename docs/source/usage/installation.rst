Installation
============

First clone CLEO's GitHub repository. Everything will be much easier for you if you clone CLEO in
your home directory. Itâ€™s not essential, but if you choose to do otherwise you may have to change
some extra paths in the bash and Python scripts.

.. code-block:: console

  $ git clone https://github.com/yoctoyotta1024/CLEO.git


Everything will also be much easier for you if you setup and use CLEO with a python version and
all the packages as listed in our ``pyproject.toml`` file. You can acheive this quickly and
simply using `uv <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/>`_ (*hint*: optionally, you can install ``uv`` within
a Conda/Micromamba environment using our ``environment.yml`` file,
e.g. ``mamba create --file=environment.yml``). Using ``uv`` to setup python, simply do:

.. code-block:: console

  $ uv sync --extra examples --extra yac

*Note*: on Levante you may need to first load an openmpi package to install mpi4py, e.g. via
```module load openmpi/4.1.2-gcc-11.2.0```

Alternatively, to only install the python dependencies required by CLEO's python package,
``cleopy``, you can just do ``uv sync --no-dev``.

For advanced users/developers, even if you already have ``uv`` installed elsewhere you may
want to install CLEO's non-python dependencies sourced from conda-forge via our ``environment.yml``,
(e.g. ``doxygen``), for examples with Micromamba: ``mamba create --file=environment.yml``.

Finally we suggest you use pre-commit. You can install our hooks via:

.. code-block:: console

  $ pre-commit install


That's it, you're done!

Now maybe you want to run some of :doc:`CLEO's examples <examples>` or try out
the :doc:`quickstart<quickstart>`...
