Welcome to CLEO's Documentation!
================================

.. note::
   Please consider that this project is under active development.

**CLEO** (/ˌkliːə/ ) is a library for
Super-Droplet Model (SDM) cloud microphysics.

The name, CLEO, is a reference to 
`Cleopatra <https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cleopatra-queen-of-Egypt>`_.
It is also an acronym, something like CLEO = Clouds in a Lagrangian Exascale mOdel.

Time to get involved! Start by :doc:`installing CLEO<usage/installation>`
and exploring some :doc:`examples<usage/examples>`. Or jump straight in
with the :doc:`quickstart<usage/quickstart>`.
