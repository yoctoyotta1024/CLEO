Welcome to CLEO's Documentation!
================================

.. note::
   Please consider that this project is under active development
   and our documentation is a work in progress.

   This documentation is built from the latest code in the main branch of CLEO's
   GitHub repository. It does not necessarily reflect a released version of CLEO, and there may be
   short-commings with respect to the on-going code development. If you have queries related to
   this or if there is anything you wish to report please do :ref:`contact us <contact>` or
   `open a new issue <https://github.com/yoctoyotta1024/CLEO/issues/new>`_ on our repository.

**CLEO** (/ˌkliːə/ ) is a library for Super-Droplet Model (SDM) cloud microphysics.

The name, CLEO, is a reference to
`Cleopatra <https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cleopatra-queen-of-Egypt>`_.
It is also an acronym, something like CLEO = Clouds made Lagrangian, Exascale, and Open-source.

Time to get involved! Start by :doc:`installing CLEO<usage/installation>` and exploring some
:doc:`examples<usage/examples>`. Or jump straight in with the :doc:`quickstart<usage/quickstart>`.
