ThermoBinary
============

ThermoBinary is a submodule of ``cleopy`` used for generating binary files
for CLEO which contains the thermodynamics and wind fields
for a 0-D, 1-D, 2-D or 3-D cartesian domain. Used when CLEO reads
dynamics from file for a one-way couplign of SDM to a FromFileDynamics
dynamics solver.
