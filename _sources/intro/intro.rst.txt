=================

.. note::
   Please consider that this project is under active development.

It seems apparent that a new implementation of SDM is required;
capable of modelling warm rain in LES with realistic boundary
conditions and large scale forcings, and capable of application
in large regional domains, with horizontal extents O(100km). CLEO is
an attempt to build such a SDM. It strives to be a library for SDM
to model warm clouds with exceptional computational performance.
