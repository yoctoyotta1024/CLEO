Installation
============

First clone CLEO's github repository.

Itâ€™s not essential, but everything
will be much easier for you if you clone CLEO in your home directory.
If you choose to do otherwise, you may have to change some paths in
the bash and Python scripts.

.. code-block:: console

  $ git clone https://github.com/yoctoyotta1024/CLEO.git

That's it, you're done!

Now maybe you want to run :doc:`some examples <examples>` or
try out the :doc:`quickstart<quickstart>`...
