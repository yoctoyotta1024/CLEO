Installation
============

First clone CLEO's github repository:


.. code-block:: console

  $ git clone https://github.com/yoctoyotta1024/CLEO.git

Itâ€™s not essential, but everything will be much easier if you clone
CLEO in your home directory. If you choose to do otherwise,
you may have to change some paths in the bash and python scripts.


That's it, you're done!


Now maybe you want to run :doc:`some examples <examples>` or
try out the :doc:`quickstart<quickstart>`...
