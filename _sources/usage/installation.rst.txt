Installation
============

First clone CLEO's GitHub repository. Everything will be much easier for you if you clone CLEO in
your home directory. Itâ€™s not essential, but if you choose to do otherwise you may have to change
some extra paths in the bash and Python scripts.

.. code-block:: console

  $ git clone https://github.com/yoctoyotta1024/CLEO.git


Everything will also be much easier for you if you set up and use an environment with the packages
we suggest in our environment.yml file, e.g. using Conda/Micromamba:

.. code-block:: console

  $ micromamba create --file=environment.yml
  $ micromamba activate cleoenv

*Note*: on Levante you need to first load an openmpi package to install mpi4py, e.g. via
```module load openmpi/4.1.2-gcc-11.2.0```

Finally we suggest you use pre-commit. You can install our hooks via:

.. code-block:: console

  $ pre-commit install


That's it, you're done!

Now maybe you want to run :doc:`some examples <examples>` or try out
the :doc:`quickstart<quickstart>`...
