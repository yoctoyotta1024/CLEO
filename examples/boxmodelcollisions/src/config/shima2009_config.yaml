# File Description:
# Configuration file for example of collisions in CLEO SDM 0-D box model.
# Note: The initial superdroplets data read from file "initsupers_filename" can be made with
# CLEO's cleopy module (see Python script "create_initsuperdropsbinary_script.py" for example of usage).
# Likewise the "grid_filename" can be made using cleopy (see "create_gbxboundariesbinary_script.py"),
# and so can the thermodynamics files when using coupled thermodynamics "fromfile".
