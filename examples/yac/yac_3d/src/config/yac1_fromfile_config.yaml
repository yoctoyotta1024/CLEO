# File Description:
# Configuration file for test of YAC with 3D time varying thermodyanamics example.
# Note: The inital superdroplets data read from file "initsupers_filename" can be made with
# CLEO's pySD module (see Python script "create_initsuperdropsbinary_script.py" for usage).
# Likewise the "grid_filename" can be made using pySD (see "create_gbxboundariesbinary_script.py"),
# and so can the thermodynamics files when using coupled thermodynamics "fromfile".
#
