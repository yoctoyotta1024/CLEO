 * @brief Write function called by StoreAccessor to write data to file system storage after the
 * data has been converted into a vector of unsigned integer types.
 *
 * This function can be used by a StoreAccessor object to write data represented as a vector of
 * unsigned integer types to the file system store under the specified key.
 *
 *
 * @param key The key under which the data will be stored in the file system store.
 * @param buffer A span representing the range of memory containing the unsigned bytes to be
 * written.
 * @return True if the write operation is successful, false otherwise.
