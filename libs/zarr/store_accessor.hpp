 * @brief A template class for converting types into vectors of single bytes to write to a "store"
 * under a given key.
 *
 * This class provides functions for converting various types (e.g., vectors / Kokkos views of
 * unsigned integers or doubles) into spans of single bytes, which can then be written to a "store"
 * under a specified key. The store is any object, but for example it could be a file system
 * satisfying the Zarr storage specification version 2.
